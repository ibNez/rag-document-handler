# RAG Document Handler Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **RAG Document Handler** project. This directory contains supplementary guides that expand on the root `README.md`.
The application forms a RAG-focused data lake using Milvus for vector embeddings and a single SQLite database (`knowledgebase.db`) for structured metadata like URLs and emails.
